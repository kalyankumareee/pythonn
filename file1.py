Python is a

 --> Object oriented Programming Language
 --> Dynamically typed Language
 --> Interpreted Language
 --> Compiled Language



Flavours of Python

--> Cpython     -  Written in C,MOst common Implementation of python
--> Jython      -  Java Implementation of Python
--> IronPython  -  Implementation of the Python Programming Language which is tightly integrated with .NET.
--> Brython     -  Browser Python,runs in browsers
--> RubtPython  -  Bridge between Python and Ruby Interprets
--> MicroPython -  Runs in Micro Controllers



Print function has 5 parameters: (object,sep,end,file,flush)

object  --> the value to be printed is object.

sep     --> seperator
#Eg
# a = 8
# b = 9
# c =89
# print(a,b,c, sep='$')

end --> which is used to add the string at the end of the value,
# # It will not keep the command to stay in same line
# Eg:
# print (str(a),b,end=='%%')
# print (str(c))

file
flush


VARIABLES :

# variable is a name which is used to identify the value of variable
# which is stored in a specific memory location


Rules to define variables:

1) Variables have to start with only alphabets , underscores.
2) The char following the 1st char can be alphabets , numbers, underscores.
3) No spaces are allowed.
4) No special characters like @#$$%!()+.
5) Case sensitive.
6) Keywords are not allowed as variables.



# Ways to define variables

# a = 8
# b = 9
# print(a,b)

# a=7 , b = 9 # error
# print(a,b)
# print(a)
# print(b)



# a=7
# b=7

# a = b = 7
# print(a, b)


# a=8, 7, 9.89, "hello"
# print(a)
# print (type(a))

# a, b = 78 #erroe
# print(a, b)

1.)Commenting is used for making documentation in a python file.
2.)When the line is commented,that line will not be considered as a part of the code.
3.)When the program is executed,commented line will not be in the part of execution.


-----> NOTE:
Single line commenting can be done using # at the beginning of the line

     Eg:
         #print("hello world")


Multiple line commenting can be done using  code . The lines between the quotes will be commented.
